	"faq.sec-1-title": "What is majority judgment?",
	"faq.sec-1-desc": "A simple and intuitive principle, which changes everything: the voter votes by giving his/her opinion on all the candidates, by attributing to each one a mention on a scale of values (e.g. Very good, Good, Fair, Insufficient, To be rejected). The candidate with the highest majority rating wins the election (the one with \"the highest majority\" rating).",
	"faq.sec-2-title": "Where does the majority judgment come from?",
	"faq.sec-2-desc": "Majority judgment is a voting method invented by two French researchers at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) in 2011, Michel Balinski and Rida Laraki.",
	"faq.sec-3-title": "What are the advantages of majority judgment?",
	"faq.sec-3-desc": "With majority judgment, the voter can fully express his opinion. He no longer has to vote \"useful\" or \"strategic\", and if he likes several candidates, he can evaluate them all positively. The voter can also reject candidates. Majority judgment allows for a much more accurate measure of voter opinion and thus a more democratic outcome. By asking voters for their opinion on each option on the ballot, majority judgment aggregates much more information than single-member plurality voting, which, by summarizing voters' opinions into a choice, ignores most of the information about what they think. Majority voting does not \"just\" produce a winner with a majority of votes. It accurately measures the credence given to each of the options and helps to refine as well as pacify decision making.",
	"faq.sec-4-title": "When and how to use majority judgment?",
	"faq.sec-4-desc": "Majority judgment applies to any type of collective vote, whether it is to elect a candidate, to retain one or several ideas during a collaborative workshop, to choose between several projects, to rank wines, etc. It can be used at all scales (local, national, international) and in all environments (schools, companies, associations, cooperatives, public communities...).",
	"faq.sec-5-title": "Who can use this application?",
	"faq.sec-5-desc": "This majority judgment application is open to anyone who wants to make a collective decision, between friends, between colleagues, between members of a group. It is free to use and free of charge. Our ambition is to offer you the best experience of collective and democratic decision making",
	"faq.sec-6-title": "How to organize an election with several thousand voters?",
	"faq.sec-6-desc": "This application is not suitable for votes with more than 1000 voters. If this is your case, we invite you to contact us by email at contact@mieuxvoter.fr. If you are organizing a closed vote with an email invitation, we suggest that you do not exceed 200 participants (the time to create the vote may then take a few minutes).",
	"faq.sec-7-title": "I have a problem, how can I get help?",
	"faq.sec-7-desc": "If you encounter a problem while using our application, please write us by mail at the following address: app@mieuxvoter.fr. Be sure to describe the problem in your message. Add in your description the link of your vote",
	"faq.sec-8-title": "Is there a limit of voters applied for \"closed\" votes, on invitation?",
	"faq.sec-8-desc": "The maximum number of voters for an invitation vote is 1000 people. However, if your need is greater than this limit, we invite you to send us an email at: contact@mieuxvoter.fr.",
	"faq.sec-9-title": "How long does the link to the administration page remain active?",
	"faq.sec-9-desc": "The links provided when you created your vote do not have an expiration date. Please keep them safe so that you can view the results of your vote.",
	"faq.sec-10-title": "How can I ensure that the same person does not vote twice?",
	"faq.sec-10-desc": "In the case of email invitation voting, only people whose email was added at the time the vote was created receive an invitation and can vote. Each invitation has a unique link with a one-time use electronic token. This token is destroyed as soon as the guest's voting participation is recorded. It therefore guarantees that each participant can only vote once. In the case of a public vote, any person can participate in the election if he or she has the link to the election.",
	"faq.sec-11-title": "When I hold an election, can I know the number and identity of voters?",
	"faq.sec-11-desc": "The number of voters is shown on your election results page. The identity of voters is secret, in order to respect the conditions of a democratic vote where anonymity protects the voter and guarantees the sincerity of the vote.",
	"faq.sec-12-title": "Can I change my vote?",
	"faq.sec-12-desc": "Once you have registered your vote, you cannot change it.",
	"faq.sec-13-title": "How can I retrieve a link to the vote or the vote results if I lost it?",
	"faq.sec-13-desc": "You cannot retrieve a link to vote or view results after it has been communicated to you. Please keep it safe. However, if you have the voting link, we can send you the link to the results.",
	"faq.sec-14-title": "How can I retrieve a link to the admin panel if I lost it?",
	"faq.sec-14-desc": "We cannot send you this link for obvious security reasons. So you have to re-create an election.",
	"faq.sec-15-title": "How do we interpret the results of a majority-rule vote?",
	"faq.sec-15-desc": "Candidates or proposals are ranked according to their majority mention, from best to worst. In the event of a tie in majority rating, the following is calculated for each candidate: the percentage of voters awarding strictly more than the common majority rating and the percentage of voters awarding strictly less than the common majority rating. The largest of the 4 values determines the result",
	"faq.sec-16-title": "What do you do with the collected data?",
	"faq.sec-16-desc": "We do not collect personal data. The sole purpose of the app.mieuxvoter.fr application is to allow everyone to organize majority judgment votes and to improve scientific research on voting methods. It has no political or commercial purpose. Better Vote attaches the utmost importance to the strict respect of privacy.",
	"faq.sec-17-title": "Who is Better Vote?",
	"faq.sec-17-desc": "\"Better Vote\" is an association under the French law of 1901 created in January 2018, which wants to improve the election and collective decision-making by promoting more democratic voting methods, such as majority judgment.",
	"faq.sec-19-title": "How can we help spread the word about majority judgment?",
	"faq.sec-19-desc": "Did you enjoy your democratic majority-judgment voting experience?  We're thrilled! You can help us return elections to voters by donating to our association here:",
